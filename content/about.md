## Hi there

I am a software engineer by trade. Although my day job usually requires me to do C# stuff I am greatly interested in functional programming. In my spare time I code projects that might be useful to you, please check out my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/b0wter/). My Twitter handle is [b0wter](https://twitter.com/b0wter).

I am running Fedora so most of the scripting stuff is bash with the occasional [fish shell script](https://fishshell.com/). I prefer fish script but bash is just so much more common ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

So, there you have it... enjoy!

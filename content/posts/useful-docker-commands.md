This is a collection of useful docker commands I found/made/discovered/whatever durint my time with docker:

## Docker disk usage
I've had a time where my server's disk was runnig full despite very low usage. I quickly found that docker was the culprit but I didn't know which container to blame. Use the following command to print detailed stats:
```
$ docker system df -v

Images space usage:
